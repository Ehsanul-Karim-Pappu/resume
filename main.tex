      This is an industrial automation project. In this project, two DC motor driven conveyor belts had been used. A robotic hand had been used to move an object from one conveyor belt to another. An IR sensor had been used to sense any object passing the robotic hand. When IR sensor, senses an object, then the conveyor belt stops to roll and robotic arm pick the object and move to the other conveyor belt.
